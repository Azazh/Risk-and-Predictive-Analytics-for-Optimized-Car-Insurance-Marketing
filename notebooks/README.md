## **Project Overview**  
This project involves performing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an insurance dataset to uncover insights and patterns that help understand key factors influencing insurance charges. The main objective of this analysis is to identify trends, correlations, and other important features that may inform decision-making or predictive modeling.  



## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset contains information on insurance charges based on various factors such as demographic details, health conditions, and lifestyle choices. Below are the key features included in the dataset:  
 



## **Key Insights**  



## **Features Analyzed**  
- **Univariate Analysis** 
- **Bivariate Analysis** 
- **Multivariate Analysis**


## **Data Visualizations**  
- **Histograms**: Age, BMI, and charges distributions.  
- **Boxplots**: Charges across smoker status and regions.  
- **Scatter Plots**: Correlations between charges and age/BMI.  
- **Heatmap**: Correlation matrix of numerical features.  


## **Tools and Libraries Used**  
- **Python**  
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.  
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.  



## **Setup and Execution**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azazh/Risk-and-Predictive-Analytics-for-Optimized-Car-Insurance-Marketing.git
     

2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the EDA script:  
   ```bash
   python insuranceEda.ipynb
     

4. View the outputs (graphs, tables, and insights) in the console or saved output directory.  



## **Future Improvements**  
- Extend the analysis to include predictive modeling using regression techniques.  
- Investigate feature engineering for improving data insights.  
- Apply clustering to identify groups of individuals with similar insurance costs.
