Project Overview
This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an insurance dataset to uncover insights and patterns that help understand key factors influencing insurance charges. The main objective of this analysis is to identify trends, correlations, and other important features that may inform decision-making or predictive modeling.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on insurance charges based on various factors such as demographic details, health conditions, and lifestyle choices. Below are the key features included in the dataset:

Age: The age of the individual.
Sex: Gender (male or female).
BMI: Body mass index, an indicator of body fat.
Children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
Smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes or no).
Region: Geographic location (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
Charges: Medical insurance costs billed to the individual.
Key Insights
Age and Charges: Older individuals generally incur higher medical costs.
Smoker Status: Smokers have significantly higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers.
BMI Correlation: Higher BMI values are positively correlated with increased medical charges, especially for smokers.
Regional Trends: Charges vary slightly across different regions, with no significant regional outlier.
Features Analyzed
Univariate Analysis: Distribution of individual variables like age, BMI, and charges.
Bivariate Analysis: Relationship between charges and categorical/numerical variables such as smoker status, BMI, and age.
Multivariate Analysis: Combined impact of multiple features (e.g., smoker status and BMI on charges).
Data Visualizations
Histograms: Age, BMI, and charges distributions.
Boxplots: Charges across smoker status and regions.
Scatter Plots: Correlations between charges and age/BMI.
Heatmap: Correlation matrix of numerical features.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
Setup and Execution
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the EDA script:

bash
Copy code
python eda_insurance.py
View the outputs (graphs, tables, and insights) in the console or saved output directory.

Future Improvements
Extend the analysis to include predictive modeling using regression techniques.
Investigate feature engineering for improving data insights.
Apply clustering to identify groups of individuals with similar insurance costs.
